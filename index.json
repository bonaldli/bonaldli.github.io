Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not seen improvements accordingly. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pre-training while maintaining their fundamental structures. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. Specifically, ST-LLM redefines the timesteps at each location as tokens and incorporates a spatial-temporal embedding module to learn the spatial location and global temporal representations of tokens. Then these representations are fused to provide each token with unified spatial and temporal information. Furthermore, we propose a novel partially frozen attention strategy of the LLM, which is designed to capture spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios.","tags":["Large Language Model","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Spatial Time Series","Time Series","Smart Mobility","Domain Adaptation","Model Fine Tuning","Prediction"],"title":"Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenxi Liu","Qianxiong Xu","Hao Miao","Sun Yang","Lingzheng Zhang","Cheng Long","Ziyue LI","Rui Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1717419699,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717419699,"objectID":"d126b153cac212609e40f017d67adbbe","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/timecma/","publishdate":"2024-06-07T15:01:39+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/timecma/","section":"publication","summary":"The widespread adoption of scalable mobile sensing has led to large amounts of time series data for real-world applications. A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.","tags":["Large Language Model","LLMs for Forcasting","Prediction","Time Series","Natural Language Understanding"],"title":"TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhishuai Li","Ziyue LI","Xiaoru Hu","Guoqing Du","Yunhao Nie","Feng Zhu","Lei Bai","Rui Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1717345435,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717345435,"objectID":"81e7bb7592c38c56d1edf009f8b4710a","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/visiontraj/","publishdate":"2023-12-11T18:23:55+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/visiontraj/","section":"publication","summary":"Trajectory recovery based on the snapshots from the city-wide multi-camera network facilitates urban mobility sensing and driveway optimization. The state-of-the-art solutions devoted to such a vision-based scheme typically incorporate predefined rules or unsupervised iterative feedback, struggling with multi-fold challenges such as lack of open-source datasets for training the whole pipeline, and the vulnerability to the noises from visual inputs. In response to the dilemma, this paper proposes VisionTraj, the first learning-based model that reconstructs vehicle trajectories from snapshots recorded by road network cameras. Coupled with it, we elaborate on two rational vision-trajectory datasets, which produce extensive trajectory data along with corresponding visual snapshots, enabling supervised vision-trajectory interplay extraction. Following the data creation, based on the results from the off-the-shelf multi-modal vehicle clustering, we first re-formulate the trajectory recovery problem as a generative task and introduce the canonical Transformer as the autoregressive backbone. Then, to identify clustering noises (e.g., false positives) with the bound on the snapshots' spatiotemporal dependencies, a GCN-based soft-denoising module is conducted based on the fine- and coarse-grained Re-ID clusters. Additionally, we harness strong semantic information extracted from the tracklet to provide detailed insights into the vehicle's entry and exit actions during trajectory recovery. The denoising and tracklet components can also act as plug-and-play modules to boost baselines. Experimental results on the two hand-crafted datasets show that the proposed VisionTraj achieves a maximum +11.5% improvement against the sub-best model.","tags":["Spatiotemporal Analysis","Trajectory","Graph Neural Network","Graph Machine Learning","Computer Vision","Multi-modality"],"title":"VisionTraj: A Noise-Robust Trajectory Recovery Framework based on Large-scale Camera Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" International Awards and Prizes  Peter Luh Young Researcher Award (Runner-up) for the paper “ Dynamic Causal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction”, selected 3/600, highly prestigious, IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (2023).

Consequently, there is a critical need to filter out unnecessary tables and columns, directing the language models attention to relevant tables and columns with schema-linking, to reduce errors during SQL generation. Previous approaches have involved sorting tables and columns based on their relevance to the question, selecting the top-ranked ones for sorting, or directly identifying the necessary tables and columns for SQL generation. However, these methods face challenges such as lengthy model training times, high consumption of expensive GPT-4 tokens in few-shot prompts, or suboptimal performance in schema linking. Therefore, we propose an inventive schema linking method in two steps: Firstly, generate an initial SQL query by utilizing the complete database schema. Subsequently, extract tables and columns from the initial SQL query to create a concise schema. Using CodeLlama-34B, when comparing the schemas obtained by mainstream methods with ours for SQL generation, our schema performs optimally.

However, the existing methods lack effective learning mechanisms capable of absorbing dynamic information inherent to a specific scenario and universally applicable dynamic information across various scenarios. Moreover, within each specific scenario, they fail to fully capture the essential empirical experiences about how to coordinate between neighboring and target intersections, leading to sub-optimal system-wide outcomes. Viewing these issues, we propose DuaLight, which aims to leverage both the experiential information within a single scenario and the generalizable information across various scenarios for enhanced decision-making. Specifically, DuaLight introduces a scenario-specific experiential weight module with two learnable parts: Intersection-wise and Feature-wise, guiding how to adaptively utilize neighbors and input features for each scenario, thus providing a more fine-grained understanding of different intersections. Furthermore, we implement a scenario-shared Co-Train module to facilitate the learning of generalizable dynamics information across different scenarios. Empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios show DuaLight achieves competitive performance across various metrics, offering a promising solution to alleviate traffic congestion, with 3-7% improvements.

Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series and adapting large language foundation models for time series. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely Effectiveness, Efficiency and Explainability. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series.Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements.

Existing works assume that neighbors' information offers the basis for estimating the attributes of the unobserved target while ignoring non-neighbors. However, non-neighbors could also offer constructive information, and neighbors could also be misleading. To this end, we propose ``Contrastive-Prototypical'' self-supervised learning for Kriging (KCP) to refine valuable information from neighbors and recycle the one from non-neighbors. As a pre-trained paradigm, we conduct the Kriging task from a new perspective of representation: we aim to first learn robust and general representations and then recover attributes from representations. A neighboring contrastive module is designed that coarsely learns the representations by narrowing the representation distance between the target and its neighbors while pushing away the non-neighbors. In parallel, a prototypical module is introduced to identify similar representations via exchanged prediction, thus refining the misleading neighbors and recycling the useful non-neighbors from the neighboring contrast component. As a result, not all the neighbors and some of the non-neighbors will be used to infer the target. To encourage the two modules above to learn general and robust representations, we design an adaptive augmentation module that incorporates data-driven attribute augmentation and centrality-based topology augmentation over the spatiotemporal Kriging graph data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KCP compared to its peers with 6% improvements and exceptional transferability and robustness.

Our motivating example is from subway passenger flow modeling, where similarities between stations are commonly found. However, the challenges lie in the innate high-dimensionality of tensors and also the potential existence of anomalies. This is because the three tasks, i.e., dimension reduction, clustering, and anomaly decomposition, are inter-correlated to each other, and treating them in a separate manner will render a suboptimal performance. Thus, in this work, we design a tensor-based subspace clustering and anomaly decomposition technique for simultaneously outlier-robust dimension reduction and clustering for high-dimensional tensors. To achieve this, a novel low-rank robust subspace clustering decomposition model is proposed by combining Tucker decomposition, sparse anomaly decomposition, and subspace clustering. An effective algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent is proposed to update the parameters. Prudent experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework via the simulation study, with a gain of +25% clustering accuracy than benchmark methods in a hard case. The interrelations of the three tasks are also analyzed via ablation studies, validating the interrelation assumption. Moreover, a case study in the station clustering based on real passenger flow data is conducted, with quite valuable insights discovered.

Some works attempt to address fairness issues but often sacrifice transport performance. Furthermore, existing methods overlook the challenge of sample efficiency, especially when dealing with diversity-limited traffic data. Therefore, we propose a F airness-aware and sample- E fficient traffic signal control method called FELight.

Theoretical comparison with other fairness works proves why and when our fairness could bring advantages. Moreover, counterfactual data augmentation is employed to enrich interaction data, enhancing the sample efficiency of FELight. Self-supervised state representation is introduced to extract informative features from raw states, further improving sample efficiency.

Our framework comprises three key components designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most pertinent APIs for the user task among the extensive array available; (2) LLM Finetuner tunes a base LLM so that the finetuned LLM can be more capable for task planning and API calling; (3) the Demo Selector adaptively retrieves different demonstrations related to hard-to-distinguish APIs, which is further used for in-context learning to boost the final performance.

Traditional deep-learning based methods for traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their models, which are then used to make predictions on future data. However, the performance of the trained model usually degrades due to the temporal drift between the historical and future data. To make the model trained on historical data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method, instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover, to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights for different time series variables. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADCSD method.

Recently, sequential language models have been innovatively adopted for trajectory recovery in a pre-trained manner: it learns road segment representation vectors, which will be used in the downstream tasks. However, existing methods are incapable of handling complex trajectories: when the trajectory crosses remote road segments or makes several turns, which we call critical nodes, the quality of learned representations deteriorates, and the recovered trajectories skip the critical nodes. This work is dedicated to offering a more robust trajectory recovery for complex trajectories. Firstly, we define the trajectory complexity based on the detour score and entropy score and construct the complexity-aware semantic graphs correspondingly. Then, we propose a Multi-view Graph and Complexity Aware Transformer (MGCAT) model to encode these semantics in trajectory pre-training from two aspects: 1) adaptively aggregate the multi-view graph features considering trajectory pattern, and 2) higher attention to critical nodes in a complex trajectory. Such that, our MGCAT is perceptual when handling the critical scenario of complex trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale datasets. The results prove that our method learns better representations for trajectory recovery, with 5.22% higher F1-score overall and 8.16% higher F1-score for complex trajectories particularly.","tags":["Transformer","Graph Machine Learning","Attention","Pre-trained Model","Smart Mobility","Trajectory","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Graph Neural Network"],"title":"A Critical Perceptual Pre-trained Model for Complex Trajectory Recovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qianxiong Xu","Cheng Long","Ziyue LI","Sijie Ruan","Rui Zhao","Zhishuai Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1699139172,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699139172,"objectID":"8d57e8ea83620544dc10438431d55c80","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/kits-iclr24/","publishdate":"2023-12-05T00:06:12+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kits-iclr24/","section":"publication","summary":"Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.

Existing traffic forecasting studies focus on modeling spatial-temporal dynamics in traffic data, among which the graph convolution network (GCN) is at the center for exploiting the spatial dependency embedded in the road network graphs. However, these GCN-based methods operate intrinsically on the node level (e.g., road and intersection) only whereas overlooking the spatial hierarchy of the whole city. Nodes such as intersections and road segments can form clusters (e.g., regions), which could also have interactions with each other and share similarities at a higher level. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Network (AHSTN) to promote traffic forecasting by exploiting the spatial hierarchy and modeling multi-scale spatial correlations. Apart from the node-level spatiotemporal blocks, AHSTN introduces the adaptive spatiotemporal downsampling module to infer the spatial hierarchy for spatiotemporal modeling at the cluster level. Then, an adaptive spatiotemporal upsampling module is proposed to upsample the cluster-level representations to the node-level and obtain the multi-scale representations for generating predictions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that AHSTN achieves better performance over several strong baselines.","tags":["Spatial Time Series","Graph Neural Network","Graph Machine Learning","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Prediction"],"title":"Adaptive Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Network for Traffic Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaijian Liu","Shixiang Tang","Ziyue LI","Zhishuai Li","Lei Bai","Feng Zhu","Rui Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1692660499,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692660499,"objectID":"7f49b742b929cf9b6749f310516b1710","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/radnet-tmm23/","publishdate":"2023-12-06T00:28:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/radnet-tmm23/","section":"publication","summary":"Person clustering with multi-modal clues, including faces, bodies, and voices, is critical for various tasks, such as movie parsing and identity-based movie editing. Related methods such as multi-view clustering mainly project multi-modal features into a joint feature space.

As a result, these methods are not suitable for person clustering. In this paper, we propose a Relation- Aware Distribution representation Network (RAD-Net) to generate a distribution representation for multi-modal clues. The distribution representation of a clue is a vector consisting of the relation between this clue and all other clues from all modalities, thus being modality agnostic and good for person clustering. Accordingly, we introduce a graph-based method to construct distribution representation and employ a cyclic update policy to refine distribution representation progressively.

This paper takes the traffic congestion analysis as a concrete case, where a traffic intersection is usually regarded as a DAG. In a road network of multiple intersections, different intersections can only have some overlapping and distinct variables observed. For example, a signalized intersection has traffic light-related variables, whereas unsignalized ones do not. This encourages the multi-task design: with each DAG as a task, the MM-DAG tries to learn the multiple DAGs jointly so that their consensus and consistency are maximized. To this end, we innovatively propose a multi-modal regression for linear causal relationship description of different variables. Then we develop a novel Causality Difference (CD) measure and its differentiable approximator. Compared with existing SOTA measures, CD can penalize the causal structural difference among DAGs with distinct nodes and can better consider the uncertainty of causal orders. We rigidly prove our design's topological interpretation and consistency properties. We conduct thorough simulations and one case study to show the effectiveness of our MM-DAG.","tags":["Causal Learning","Traffic Management","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Multi-task Learning"],"title":"MM-DAG: Multi-task DAG Learning for Multi-modal Data--with Application for Traffic Congestion Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hui Ruan","Qingyuan Gong","Yang Chen","Jiong Chen","Ziyue LI","Xiang Su"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1687044536,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687044536,"objectID":"34e7014b1a281629f3a29a8d878823fe","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/heart-driving-mobi23/","publishdate":"2023-12-06T00:28:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/heart-driving-mobi23/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of health metrics for drivers has become increasingly crucial due to the potential impact of drivers' health conditions on traffic accidents.

Existing methods are either based on a single scenario or multiple independent scenarios, where each scenario has a separate simulation environment with predefined road network topology and traffic signal settings. These models implement training and testing in the same scenario, thus being strictly tied up with the specific setting and sacrificing model generalization heavily. While a few recent models could be trained by multiple scenarios, they require a huge amount of manual labor to label the intersection structure, hindering the model’s generalization. In this work, we aim at a general framework that could eliminate heavy labeling and model a variety of scenarios simultaneously. To this end, we propose a GEneral Scenario-Agnostic (GESA) reinforcement learning framework for traffic signal control with: (1) A general plug-in module to map all different intersections into a unified structure, freeing us from the heavy manual labor to specify the structure of intersections; (2) A unified state and action space to keep the model input and output consistently structured; (3) A large-scale co-training with multiple scenarios, leading to a generic traffic signal control algorithm. In experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm as the first one that can be co-trained with seven different scenarios without manual annotation, and get 17.20% higher rewards than benchmarks. When dealing with a new scenario, our model can still achieve 10.36% higher rewards.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Multi-task Learning","Generalist Agent","Traffic Signal Control","Traffic Management","Spatiotemporal Decision Intelligence","Domain Adaptation"],"title":"GESA: A General Scenario-agnostic Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":null,"content":" Details: 0.

There are numbers of real practical applications of ITS: For instance, when you are driving on the road, the ITS could predict how crowded the traffic will be in 15 minutes. It can also give you some personalized recommendations about your route planning etc. When the traffic becomes packed, an ITS may intelligently control the traffic signal adaptively. And if a congestion happens, the ITS could also help to detect the potential cause and predict how the congestion spread. Overall, the universal goal of an ITS is to improve the traffic condition via machine learning and artificial intelligent. But the questions are: what kind of data are we expected from the ITS? What kind of tasks are under the stage spotlight? And what kind of techniques under the umbrella of “machine learning” could offer efficient and accurate solutions? In the series of these two lectures, we will voyage the journey and find the answer together. Throughout the journey, you will see this term “spatiotemporal” or “spatial-temporal” a lot. Spot on! The traffic data is one of the most typical spatiotemporal data. And the core to make our algorithm work well is to capture these spatiotemporal correlations. If we categorize the ITS problem more detailed, we will find out there are three types of domains in ITS, and they are: (1) Static Data Analysis (e.g., flow, speed, demand), (2) Dynamic Data Analysis (e.g., trajectory), and (3) Traffic Management (e.g., traffic signal control, congestion management). We will cover all these three domains in our lectures.

In this paper, we aim to propose a unified framework that jointly learns the road network and trajectory representations end-to-end. We design domain-specific augmentations for road-road contrast and trajectory-trajectory contrast separately, i.e., road segment with its contextual neighbors and trajectory with its detour replaced and dropped alternatives, respectively. On top of that, we further introduce the road-trajectory cross-scale contrast to bridge the two scales by maximizing the total mutual information. Unlike the existing cross-scale contrastive learning methods on graphs that only contrast a graph and its belonging nodes, the contrast between road segment and trajectory is elaborately tailored via novel positive sampling and adaptive weighting strategies.

This means that the impact on the fairness of the system is in the hands of those who are less impacted by it.

An accurate data-driven detection method usually needs enough data and labels. However, in practice, there commonly exist newly set-up processes in manufacturing, and they only have quite limited data available for analysis. Borrowing the name from the recommender system, we call this process a cold-start process. The sparsity of anomaly, the deviation of the profile, and noise aggravate the detection difficulty.\nTransfer learning could help to detect anomalies for cold-start processes by transferring the knowledge from more experienced processes to the new processes. However, the existing transfer learning and multi-task learning frameworks are established on task- or domain-level relatedness. We observe instead, within a domain, some components (background and anomaly) share more commonality, others (profile deviation and noise) not. To this end, we propose a more delicate component-level transfer learning scheme, i.e., decomposition-based hybrid transfer learning (DHTL): It first decomposes a domain (e.g., a data source containing profiles) into different components (smooth background, profile deviation, anomaly, and noise); then, each component’s transferability is analyzed by expert knowledge; Lastly, different transfer learning techniques could be tailored accordingly.

The learned clusters further enable commercially beneficial actions such as customized services, promotions, data-driven urban-use planning, peak hour discovery, and so on. However, the individualized passenger modeling is very challenging for the following reasons: 1) The individual passenger travel data are multi-dimensional spatiotemporal big data, including at least the origin, destination, and time dimensions; 2) Moreover, individualized passenger travel patterns usually depend on the external environment, such as the distances and functions of locations, which are ignored in most current works. This work proposes a multi-clustering model to learn the latent clusters along the multiple dimensions of Origin, Destination, Time, and eventually, Passenger (ODT-P). We develop a graph-regularized tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model by first extending the traditional LDA model into a tensor version and then applies to individual travel data. Then, the external information of stations is formulated as semantic graphs and incorporated as the Laplacian regularizations; Furthermore, to improve the model scalability when dealing with massive data, an online stochastic learning method based on tensorized variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed. Finally, a case study based on passengers in the Hong Kong metro system is conducted and demonstrates that a better clustering performance is achieved compared to state-of-the-arts with the improvement in point-wise mutual information index and algorithm convergence speed by a factor of two.","tags":["Tensor Topic Model","Tensor","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Graph Machine Learning","Trajectory","Smart Mobility","Data Efficiency","Clustering"],"title":"Individualized Passenger Travel Pattern Multi-Clustering based on Graph Regularized Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":"","date":1618827655,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618827655,"objectID":"6b27fc4837ba94edf2865654d9017169","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/icde2021-phdsym/","publishdate":"2021-05-04T18:20:55+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icde2021-phdsym/","section":"publication","summary":"Individualized passenger travel pattern is of significant research value since the abundant information from individual trajectory data could help discover the useful insights about the multi-clustering of origin, destination, time, etc., and the passenger cluster.

With the collaboration the Hong Kong Metro, we realize the task to provide the citywide prediction covering all 100 stations simultaneously is quite essential yet rather challenging, especially when the data has strong spatiotemporal correlation.\nChallenge We observed two types of spatial correlations and two types of temporal correlations in the data. We have spot that, for spatial correlations: (S1) Geographical correlation: the passenger flow of a station is usually affected by its spatially adjacent neighbors; (S2) Contextual correlations: two stations sharing similar functionalities (business center, residential area or school, etc.) are more likely to have similar passenger flows. For temporal correlations: (T1) Daily correlation: the profile is correlated with previous days of the same week; (T2) Weekly correlation: the profile is correlated with the same day of previous weeks.\nFor the metro operational team, to provide long-term (several days ahead) prediction and short-term (several hours ahead) prediction are both important. And there are little work to both consider spatiotemporal correlation and offer citywide long- and short-term prediction.\nMethodology To tackle this challenge, we first formulate data as a three-dimensional tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}^{station \\times point \\times day}$ with dimension station, day, time point, to preserve the spatiotemporal nature of the data. (1.1) For long-term prediction, we proposed a \u0026ldquo;2-step 2D-ARMA\u0026rdquo; tensor prediction model, which firstly uses tensor decomposition to get day-feature matrix $\\mathbf{U}^{day}$, and then conducts 2D-ARMA prediction model on this $\\mathbf{U}^{day}$, capturing the daily and weekly correlations in a better way. (1.2) Another challenge for long-term prediction is how to update prediction real-time when new data keep arriving. To tackle this, we also propose a recursive dynamic updating method. (2) For short-term prediction, we first directly used Low Rank Tensor Completion (LRTC) method to treat the prediction horizon as missing part and to complete it. But we found an interesting phenomenon: in homogeneous stations LRTC works well, however, LRTC malfunctions in heterogeneous stations. we proposed a temporary solution for it: a \u0026ldquo;Tensor Clustering + Tensor Completion\u0026rdquo; prediction model which first clusters stations and then conducts tensor completion within each station cluster for prediction.\nResults Our method improved the prediction results significantly: for long-term prediction, 30% higher accuracy is achieved; Recursive dynamic updating method could improve the following 3 hours prediction by around 20%. For short-term prediction, with the homogeneity of stations guaranteed, and the tensor completion within one cluster can improve the prediction by 30%\n","date":1593057703,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593057703,"objectID":"e42f614dc55b227630b9ab38c11d4ee1","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/lstensor-case2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-26T12:01:43+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lstensor-case2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper is awarded with IEEE CASE 2020 Best Conference Paper Award","tags":["Spatiotemporal Analysis","Spatial Time Series","Tensor Decomposition","Tensor","Tensor Completion","Data Efficiency","Smart Mobility"],"title":"Long-Short Term Spatiotemporal Tensor Prediction for Passenger Flow Profile","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI","Nurettin Dorukhan Sergin","Hao Yan","Chen Zhang","Fugee Tsung"],"categories":["AAAI","Conference"],"content":" Award:\n This paper is awarded with Best Student Paper Finalist Award in INFORMS 2020 Quality, Statistics, and Reliability (QSR) Section.\n Challenge From our last paper, we found out low-rank tensor completion tends to ill-perform in heterogeneous stations. This is because LRTC assume a low rank structure in data, i.e. low-rank property implies that data in all stations are strongly and linearly dependent. However, two spatial correlations in station dimension are observed: only stations that are geographically close or functionally similar are more likely to have same passenger flow patterns. We offered a temporary solution by conducting LRTC within each station cluster to guarantee low-rank structure. But we would also like to look for a better solution, a low-rank tensor completion method that could directly handle the data with local spatial correlations.\nMethodology Therefore we proposed a tensor completion method for Weakly-dependent Data on Graph (WDG). We formulate the geographical correlation and functional similarity as two graphs, and introduce them as two Laplacian regularizations into LRTC, namely, into station-feature matrix $\\mathbf{U}^{station}$, such that if two stations are close on the two graphs, they have similar parameters on $\\mathbf{U}^{station}$. Besides, since there are those two graphs on station dimension, if any 2 stations are randomly picked, they’re less likely to be highly-dependent if they’re not connected in either of two graphs. We formulate this weak dependency as a sparse coding via $l_1$-norm, such that a station is represented with only a small amount of highly-related stations as “basis”.\nResults We are the first work to provide a Low Rank Tensor Completion solution to weakly-dependent pattern on graphs. And the completion result could achieve 40% higher accuracy.\n","date":1585902777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585902777,"objectID":"301e0d56447b06e6b132164f145d35b7","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/wdgtc-aaai20/","publishdate":"2020-04-03T16:32:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wdgtc-aaai20/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-rank tensor decomposition and completion have attracted significant interest from academia given the ubiquity of tensor data.

Dr Laura M.

After a more accurate model and estimation, monitoring can be further conducted to contribute more practical value to the process control. The two most popular ways to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies can be summarized as follows: the first is to introduce regularization terms according to the auxiliary information; the second is to form data in tensor form, especially high-dimensional data, and then apply the corresponding tensor analysis method. Last but not least, after performing accurate estimation, a monitoring statistic can be constructed and the monitoring scheme applied to calculate the control limit and start the quality control process.","tags":["Profile Monitoring","Functional Data","Spatiotemporal Analysis"],"title":"Discussion of 'A novel approach to the analysis of spatial and functional data over complex domains' ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583312872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583312872,"objectID":"7f88c7c044ee3409b489001c58f5f7b9","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/my-dating-hack/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T17:07:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-dating-hack/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Prediction"],"title":"My Dating Hack","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":["Competition"],"content":"","date":1583309763,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583309763,"objectID":"4ee35dcf32773d55424929f343ecd970","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/jd-prediction/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T16:16:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/jd-prediction/","section":"project","summary":"The Sale Prediction","tags":["JD.COM","Global Competition"],"title":"JD Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566459996,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566459996,"objectID":"bcba5edfc23818c9a75cdbda54edad38","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/post/my-arhikes/","publishdate":"2019-08-22T15:46:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/my-arhikes/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My Hikes","type":"post"}]

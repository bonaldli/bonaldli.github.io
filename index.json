With the collaboration the Hong Kong Metro, we realize the task to provide the citywide prediction covering all 100 stations simultaneously is quite essential yet rather challenging, especially when the data has strong spatiotemporal correlation.\nChallenge We observed two types of spatial correlations and two types of temporal correlations in the data. We have spot that, for spatial correlations: (S1) Geographical correlation: the passenger flow of a station is usually affected by its spatially adjacent neighbors; (S2) Contextual correlations: two stations sharing similar functionalities (business center, residential area or school, etc.) are more likely to have similar passenger flows. For temporal correlations: (T1) Daily correlation: the profile is correlated with previous days of the same week; (T2) Weekly correlation: the profile is correlated with the same day of previous weeks.\nFor the metro operational team, to provide long-term (several days ahead) prediction and short-term (several hours ahead) prediction are both important. And there are little work to both consider spatiotemporal correlation and offer citywide long- and short-term prediction.\nMethodology To tackle this challenge, we first formulate data as a three-dimensional tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}^{station \\times point \\times day}$ with dimension station, day, time point, to preserve the spatiotemporal nature of the data. (1.1) For long-term prediction, we proposed a \u0026ldquo;2-step 2D-ARMA\u0026rdquo; tensor prediction model, which firstly uses tensor decomposition to get day-feature matrix $\\mathbf{U}^{day}$, and then conducts 2D-ARMA prediction model on this $\\mathbf{U}^{day}$, capturing the daily and weekly correlations in a better way. (1.2) Another challenge for long-term prediction is how to update prediction real-time when new data keep arriving. To tackle this, we also propose a recursive dynamic updating method. (2) For short-term prediction, we first directly used Low Rank Tensor Completion (LRTC) method to treat the prediction horizon as missing part and to complete it. But we found an interesting phenomenon: in homogeneous stations LRTC works well, however, LRTC malfunctions in heterogeneous stations. we proposed a temporary solution for it: a \u0026ldquo;Tensor Clustering + Tensor Completion\u0026rdquo; prediction model which first clusters stations and then conducts tensor completion within each station cluster for prediction.\nResults Our method improved the prediction results significantly: for long-term prediction, 30% higher accuracy is achieved; Recursive dynamic updating method could improve the following 3 hours prediction by around 20%. For short-term prediction, with the homogeneity of stations guaranteed, and the tensor completion within one cluster can improve the prediction by 30%\n","date":1598068903,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598068903,"objectID":"30955b18fe0a34fe443cf3f953821dcc","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/case2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-22T12:01:43+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/case2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper is awarded with IEEE CASE 2020 Best Conference Paper Award","tags":["Spatiotemporal Analysis","Tensor Decomposition","Tensor Completion","Prediction","Tensor"],"title":"Long-Short Term Spatiotemporal Tensor Prediction for Passenger Flow Profile","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Ziyue LI","Nurettin Dorukhan Sergin","Hao Yan","Chen Zhang","Fugee Tsung"],"categories":["AAAI","Conference"],"content":" Award:\n This paper is awarded with Best Student Paper Finalist Award in INFORMS 2020 Quality, Statistics, and Reliability (QSR) Section.\n Challenge From our last paper, we found out low-rank tensor completion tends to ill-perform in heterogeneous stations. This is because LRTC assume a low rank structure in data, i.e. low-rank property implies that data in all stations are strongly and linearly dependent. However, two spatial correlations in station dimension are observed: only stations that are geographically close or functionally similar are more likely to have same passenger flow patterns. We offered a temporary solution by conducting LRTC within each station cluster to guarantee low-rank structure. But we would also like to look for a better solution, a low-rank tensor completion method that could directly handle the data with local spatial correlations.\nMethodology Therefore we proposed a tensor completion method for Weakly-dependent Data on Graph (WDG). We formulate the geographical correlation and functional similarity as two graphs, and introduce them as two Laplacian regularizations into LRTC, namely, into station-feature matrix $\\mathbf{U}^{station}$, such that if two stations are close on the two graphs, they have similar parameters on $\\mathbf{U}^{station}$. Besides, since there are those two graphs on station dimension, if any 2 stations are randomly picked, they’re less likely to be highly-dependent if they’re not connected in either of two graphs. We formulate this weak dependency as a sparse coding via $l_1$-norm, such that a station is represented with only a small amount of highly-related stations as “basis”.\nResults We are the first work to provide a Low Rank Tensor Completion solution to weakly-dependent pattern on graphs. And the completion result could achieve 40% higher accuracy.\n","date":1585902777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585902777,"objectID":"3f63b023de3df77eb90974843db24222","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/aaai/","publishdate":"2020-04-03T16:32:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/aaai/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-rank tensor decomposition and completion have attracted significant interest from academia given the ubiquity of tensor data. However, the low-rank structure is a global property, which will not be fulfilled when the data presents complex and weak dependencies given specific graph structures.

In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition and completion framework by introducing the L1-norm penalty and Graph Laplacian penalty to model the weakly dependency on graph.

After a more accurate model and estimation, monitoring can be further conducted to contribute more practical value to the process control. The two most popular ways to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies can be summarized as follows: the first is to introduce regularization terms according to the auxiliary information; the second is to form data in tensor form, especially high-dimensional data, and then apply the corresponding tensor analysis method. Last but not least, after performing accurate estimation, a monitoring statistic can be constructed and the monitoring scheme applied to calculate the control limit and start the quality control process.","tags":["Profile Monitoring","Functional Data","Spatiotemporal Analysis"],"title":"Discussion of 'A novel approach to the analysis of spatial and functional data over complex domains' ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Ziyue LI"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583312872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583312872,"objectID":"7f88c7c044ee3409b489001c58f5f7b9","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/my-dating-hack/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T17:07:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-dating-hack/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Prediction"],"title":"My Dating Hack","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Ziyue LI"],"categories":["Competition"],"content":"","date":1583309763,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583309763,"objectID":"4ee35dcf32773d55424929f343ecd970","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/jd-prediction/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T16:16:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/jd-prediction/","section":"project","summary":"The Sale Prediction","tags":["JD.COM","Global Competition"],"title":"JD Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566459996,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566459996,"objectID":"bcba5edfc23818c9a75cdbda54edad38","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/post/my-arhikes/","publishdate":"2019-08-22T15:46:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/my-arhikes/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My Hikes","type":"post"}]

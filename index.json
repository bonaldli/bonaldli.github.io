However, as the number of agents increases, the issues of hallucination in LLMs and coordination in multi-agent systems (MAS) have become increasingly pronounced. Additionally, the efficient utilization of tokens becomes a critical consideration when employing LLMs to facilitate the interactions of large numbers of agents. In this paper, we present a novel framework aimed at enhancing coordination and decision-making capabilities of LLMs within large-scale multi-agent environments. Our approach draws inspiration from the actor-critic framework employed in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and we develop a modular and token-efficient solution that effectively addresses challenges presented by LLMs and MAS.

However, real-world complex systems present three prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited; (2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks; (3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them. In response, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing the Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities of LLM-based agents operating within real-world systems. Our framework comprises three key components designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most pertinent APIs for the user task among the extensive array available; (2) LLM Finetuner tunes a base LLM so that the finetuned LLM can be more capable for task planning and API calling; (3) the Demo Selector adaptively retrieves different demonstrations related to hard-to-distinguish APIs, which is further used for in-context learning to boost the final performance. We validate our methods using a real-world commercial system as well as an open-sourced academic dataset, and the outcomes clearly showcase the efficacy of each individual component as well as the integrated framework.

However, existing methods cannot easily cluster the passengers due to the hierarchical structure of the passenger trip information, including multiple trips within each passenger and multi-dimensional information about each trip. Furthermore, existing approaches rely on an accurate specification of the clustering number to start. Finally, existing methods do not consider spatial semantic graphs such as geographical proximity and functional similarity between the locations. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor Dirichlet Process Multinomial Mixture model with graphs, which can preserve the hierarchical structure of the multi-dimensional trip information and cluster them in a unified one-step manner with the ability to determine the number of clusters automatically. The spatial graphs are utilized in community detection to link the semantic neighbors. We further propose a tensor version of Collapsed Gibbs Sampling method with a minimum cluster size requirement.

Recently, sequential language models have been innovatively adopted for trajectory recovery in a pre-trained manner: it learns road segment representation vectors, which will be used in the downstream tasks. However, existing methods are incapable of handling complex trajectories: when the trajectory crosses remote road segments or makes several turns, which we call critical nodes, the quality of learned representations deteriorates, and the recovered trajectories skip the critical nodes. This work is dedicated to offering a more robust trajectory recovery for complex trajectories. Firstly, we define the trajectory complexity based on the detour score and entropy score and construct the complexity-aware semantic graphs correspondingly. Then, we propose a Multi-view Graph and Complexity Aware Transformer (MGCAT) model to encode these semantics in trajectory pre-training from two aspects: 1) adaptively aggregate the multi-view graph features considering trajectory pattern, and 2) higher attention to critical nodes in a complex trajectory. Such that, our MGCAT is perceptual when handling the critical scenario of complex trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale datasets. The results prove that our method learns better representations for trajectory recovery, with 5.22% higher F1-score overall and 8.16% higher F1-score for complex trajectories particularly.","tags":["Transformer","Graph Machine Learning","Attention","Pre-trained Model","Smart Transportation","Trajectory","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Graph Neural Network"],"title":"A Critical Perceptual Pre-trained Model for Complex Trajectory Recovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qianxiong Xu","Cheng Long","Ziyue LI","Sijie Ruan","Rui Zhao","Zhishuai Li"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1699139172,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699139172,"objectID":"8d57e8ea83620544dc10438431d55c80","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/kits-iclr24/","publishdate":"2023-12-05T00:06:12+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kits-iclr24/","section":"publication","summary":"Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.

Existing traffic forecasting studies focus on modeling spatial-temporal dynamics in traffic data, among which the graph convolution network (GCN) is at the center for exploiting the spatial dependency embedded in the road network graphs. However, these GCN-based methods operate intrinsically on the node level (e.g., road and intersection) only whereas overlooking the spatial hierarchy of the whole city. Nodes such as intersections and road segments can form clusters (e.g., regions), which could also have interactions with each other and share similarities at a higher level. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Network (AHSTN) to promote traffic forecasting by exploiting the spatial hierarchy and modeling multi-scale spatial correlations. Apart from the node-level spatiotemporal blocks, AHSTN introduces the adaptive spatiotemporal downsampling module to infer the spatial hierarchy for spatiotemporal modeling at the cluster level. Then, an adaptive spatiotemporal upsampling module is proposed to upsample the cluster-level representations to the node-level and obtain the multi-scale representations for generating predictions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that AHSTN achieves better performance over several strong baselines.","tags":["Spatial Time Series","Graph Neural Network","Graph Machine Learning","Spatiotemporal Analysis"],"title":"Adaptive Case23","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaijian Liu","Shixiang Tang","Ziyue LI","Zhishuai Li","Lei Bai","Feng Zhu","Rui Zhao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1692660499,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692660499,"objectID":"7f49b742b929cf9b6749f310516b1710","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/radnet-tmm23/","publishdate":"2023-12-06T00:28:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/radnet-tmm23/","section":"publication","summary":"Person clustering with multi-modal clues, including faces, bodies, and voices, is critical for various tasks, such as movie parsing and identity-based movie editing. Related methods such as multi-view clustering mainly project multi-modal features into a joint feature space. However, multi-modal clue features are usually rather weakly correlated due to the semantic gap from the modality-specific uniqueness. As a result, these methods are not suitable for person clustering. In this paper, we propose a Relation- Aware Distribution representation Network (RAD-Net) to generate a distribution representation for multi-modal clues. The distribution representation of a clue is a vector consisting of the relation between this clue and all other clues from all modalities, thus being modality agnostic and good for person clustering. Accordingly, we introduce a graph-based method to construct distribution representation and employ a cyclic update policy to refine distribution representation progressively. Our method achieves substantial improvements of +6% and +8.2% in F-score on the Video Person-Clustering Dataset (VPCD) and VoxCeleb2 multi-view clustering dataset, respectively.","tags":["Multi-modality","Computer Vision"],"title":"Relation-Aware Distribution Representation Network for Person Clustering With Multiple Modalities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Lan","Ziyue LI","Zhishuai Li","Lei Bai","Man Li","Fugee Tsung","Wolfgang Ketter","Rui Zhao","Chen Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1691105314,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691105314,"objectID":"406300cfb907a0e793afe0e66cc8e0e7","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/mmdag-kdd23/","publishdate":"2023-12-06T00:28:34+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mmdag-kdd23/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes to learn Multi-task, Multi-modal Direct Acyclic Graphs (MM-DAGs), which are commonly observed in complex systems, e.g., traffic, manufacturing, and weather systems, whose variables are multi-modal with scalars, vectors, and functions. This paper takes the traffic congestion analysis as a concrete case, where a traffic intersection is usually regarded as a DAG. In a road network of multiple intersections, different intersections can only have some overlapping and distinct variables observed. For example, a signalized intersection has traffic light-related variables, whereas unsignalized ones do not. This encourages the multi-task design: with each DAG as a task, the MM-DAG tries to learn the multiple DAGs jointly so that their consensus and consistency are maximized. To this end, we innovatively propose a multi-modal regression for linear causal relationship description of different variables. Then we develop a novel Causality Difference (CD) measure and its differentiable approximator. Compared with existing SOTA measures, CD can penalize the causal structural difference among DAGs with distinct nodes and can better consider the uncertainty of causal orders. We rigidly prove our design's topological interpretation and consistency properties. We conduct thorough simulations and one case study to show the effectiveness of our MM-DAG.","tags":["Causal Inference","Traffic Management","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Multi-task Learning"],"title":"MM-DAG: Multi-task DAG Learning for Multi-modal Data--with Application for Traffic Congestion Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hui Ruan","Qingyuan Gong","Yang Chen","Jiong Chen","Ziyue LI","Xiang Su"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1687044536,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687044536,"objectID":"34e7014b1a281629f3a29a8d878823fe","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/heart-driving-mobi23/","publishdate":"2023-12-06T00:28:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/heart-driving-mobi23/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of health metrics for drivers has become increasingly crucial due to the potential impact of drivers' health conditions on traffic accidents.

Existing methods are either based on a single scenario or multiple independent scenarios, where each scenario has a separate simulation environment with predefined road network topology and traffic signal settings. These models implement training and testing in the same scenario, thus being strictly tied up with the specific setting and sacrificing model generalization heavily. While a few recent models could be trained by multiple scenarios, they require a huge amount of manual labor to label the intersection structure, hindering the model’s generalization. In this work, we aim at a general framework that could eliminate heavy labeling and model a variety of scenarios simultaneously. To this end, we propose a GEneral Scenario-Agnostic (GESA) reinforcement learning framework for traffic signal control with: (1) A general plug-in module to map all different intersections into a unified structure, freeing us from the heavy manual labor to specify the structure of intersections; (2) A unified state and action space to keep the model input and output consistently structured; (3) A large-scale co-training with multiple scenarios, leading to a generic traffic signal control algorithm. In experiments, we demonstrate our algorithm as the first one that can be co-trained with seven different scenarios without manual annotation, and get 17.20% higher rewards than benchmarks. When dealing with a new scenario, our model can still achieve 10.36% higher rewards.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Multi-task Learning","Generalist Agent","Traffic Signal Control","Traffic Management","Spatiotemporal Decision Intelligence","Model Efficiency"],"title":"A General Scenario-agnostic Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":null,"content":" Details: 0.

There are numbers of real practical applications of ITS: For instance, when you are driving on the road, the ITS could predict how crowded the traffic will be in 15 minutes. It can also give you some personalized recommendations about your route planning etc. When the traffic becomes packed, an ITS may intelligently control the traffic signal adaptively. And if a congestion happens, the ITS could also help to detect the potential cause and predict how the congestion spread. Overall, the universal goal of an ITS is to improve the traffic condition via machine learning and artificial intelligent. But the questions are: what kind of data are we expected from the ITS? What kind of tasks are under the stage spotlight? And what kind of techniques under the umbrella of “machine learning” could offer efficient and accurate solutions? In the series of these two lectures, we will voyage the journey and find the answer together. Throughout the journey, you will see this term “spatiotemporal” or “spatial-temporal” a lot. Spot on! The traffic data is one of the most typical spatiotemporal data. And the core to make our algorithm work well is to capture these spatiotemporal correlations. If we categorize the ITS problem more detailed, we will find out there are three types of domains in ITS, and they are: (1) Static Data Analysis (e.g., flow, speed, demand), (2) Dynamic Data Analysis (e.g., trajectory), and (3) Traffic Management (e.g., traffic signal control, congestion management). We will cover all these three domains in our lectures. Last but not the least, we will offer abundant resources including famous research papers, public datasets, open source codes, and so on if you are interested in this research area.","tags":["Intelligent Transport Systems","Smart Mobility","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Tensor","Topic Model","Causal Inference","Contrastive Learning"],"title":"Advanced Machine Learning for Smart Transportation","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Details: 0.

In this paper, we aim to propose a unified framework that jointly learns the road network and trajectory representations end-to-end. We design domain-specific augmentations for road-road contrast and trajectory-trajectory contrast separately, i.e., road segment with its contextual neighbors and trajectory with its detour replaced and dropped alternatives, respectively. On top of that, we further introduce the road-trajectory cross-scale contrast to bridge the two scales by maximizing the total mutual information. Unlike the existing cross-scale contrastive learning methods on graphs that only contrast a graph and its belonging nodes, the contrast between road segment and trajectory is elaborately tailored via novel positive sampling and adaptive weighting strategies.

We argue that the development of AI systems is marked by a central paradox: the less participation one stakeholder has within the AI system’s life cycle, the more influence they have over the way the system will function. This means that the impact on the fairness of the system is in the hands of those who are less impacted by it. However, most of the existing works ignore how different aspects of AI fairness are dynamically and adaptively affected by different stages of AI system development. To this end, we present a use case to discuss fairness in the development of corporate wellness programs using smart wearables and AI algorithms to analyze data. The four key stakeholders throughout this type of AI system development process are presented. These stakeholders are called service designer, algorithm designer, system deployer, and end-user. We identify three core aspects of AI fairness, namely, contextual fairness, model fairness, and device fairness. We propose a relative contribution of the four stakeholders to the three aspects of fairness. Furthermore, we propose the boundaries and interactions between the four roles, from which we make our conclusion about the possible unfairness in such an AI developing process.","tags":["AI Ethics","Smart Devices","AI for Good","AI Fairness"],"title":"The paradox of the artificial intelligence system development process: the use case of corporate wellness programs using smart wearables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI","Hao Yan","Chen Zhang","Fugee Tsung"],"categories":["Conference"],"content":" Award:\n This paper is awarded with Best Student Paper Finalist Award in INFORMS 2020 Data Mining Section.\n After the previous two works in station-wise traffic flow prediction, we realized this mass traffic analysis at a macro level neglects the research value and abundant information of individual passenger travel data.

The learned clusters further enable commercially beneficial actions such as customized services, promotions, data-driven urban-use planning, peak hour discovery, and so on. However, the individualized passenger modeling is very challenging for the following reasons: 1) The individual passenger travel data are multi-dimensional spatiotemporal big data, including at least the origin, destination, and time dimensions; 2) Moreover, individualized passenger travel patterns usually depend on the external environment, such as the distances and functions of locations, which are ignored in most current works. This work proposes a multi-clustering model to learn the latent clusters along the multiple dimensions of Origin, Destination, Time, and eventually, Passenger (ODT-P). We develop a graph-regularized tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model by first extending the traditional LDA model into a tensor version and then applies to individual travel data. Then, the external information of stations is formulated as semantic graphs and incorporated as the Laplacian regularizations; Furthermore, to improve the model scalability when dealing with massive data, an online stochastic learning method based on tensorized variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed.

An accurate data-driven detection method usually needs enough data and labels. However, in practice, there commonly exist newly set-up processes in manufacturing, and they only have quite limited data available for analysis. Borrowing the name from the recommender system, we call this process a cold-start process. The sparsity of anomaly, the deviation of the profile, and noise aggravate the detection difficulty.\nTransfer learning could help to detect anomalies for cold-start processes by transferring the knowledge from more experienced processes to the new processes. However, the existing transfer learning and multi-task learning frameworks are established on task- or domain-level relatedness. We observe instead, within a domain, some components (background and anomaly) share more commonality, others (profile deviation and noise) not. To this end, we propose a more delicate component-level transfer learning scheme, i.e., decomposition-based hybrid transfer learning (DHTL): It first decomposes a domain (e.g., a data source containing profiles) into different components (smooth background, profile deviation, anomaly, and noise); then, each component’s transferability is analyzed by expert knowledge; Lastly, different transfer learning techniques could be tailored accordingly. We adopted the Bayesian probabilistic hierarchical model to formulate parameter transfer for the background, and “L2,1+L1”-norm to formulate low dimension feature-representation transfer for the anomaly. An efficient algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descend is proposed to learn the parameters.

With the collaboration the Hong Kong Metro, we realize the task to provide the citywide prediction covering all 100 stations simultaneously is quite essential yet rather challenging, especially when the data has strong spatiotemporal correlation.\nChallenge We observed two types of spatial correlations and two types of temporal correlations in the data. We have spot that, for spatial correlations: (S1) Geographical correlation: the passenger flow of a station is usually affected by its spatially adjacent neighbors; (S2) Contextual correlations: two stations sharing similar functionalities (business center, residential area or school, etc.) are more likely to have similar passenger flows. For temporal correlations: (T1) Daily correlation: the profile is correlated with previous days of the same week; (T2) Weekly correlation: the profile is correlated with the same day of previous weeks.\nFor the metro operational team, to provide long-term (several days ahead) prediction and short-term (several hours ahead) prediction are both important. And there are little work to both consider spatiotemporal correlation and offer citywide long- and short-term prediction.\nMethodology To tackle this challenge, we first formulate data as a three-dimensional tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{X}}^{station \\times point \\times day}$ with dimension station, day, time point, to preserve the spatiotemporal nature of the data. (1.1) For long-term prediction, we proposed a \u0026ldquo;2-step 2D-ARMA\u0026rdquo; tensor prediction model, which firstly uses tensor decomposition to get day-feature matrix $\\mathbf{U}^{day}$, and then conducts 2D-ARMA prediction model on this $\\mathbf{U}^{day}$, capturing the daily and weekly correlations in a better way. (1.2) Another challenge for long-term prediction is how to update prediction real-time when new data keep arriving. To tackle this, we also propose a recursive dynamic updating method. (2) For short-term prediction, we first directly used Low Rank Tensor Completion (LRTC) method to treat the prediction horizon as missing part and to complete it. But we found an interesting phenomenon: in homogeneous stations LRTC works well, however, LRTC malfunctions in heterogeneous stations. we proposed a temporary solution for it: a \u0026ldquo;Tensor Clustering + Tensor Completion\u0026rdquo; prediction model which first clusters stations and then conducts tensor completion within each station cluster for prediction.\nResults Our method improved the prediction results significantly: for long-term prediction, 30% higher accuracy is achieved; Recursive dynamic updating method could improve the following 3 hours prediction by around 20%. For short-term prediction, with the homogeneity of stations guaranteed, and the tensor completion within one cluster can improve the prediction by 30%\n","date":1593057703,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593057703,"objectID":"e42f614dc55b227630b9ab38c11d4ee1","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/lstensor-case2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-26T12:01:43+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lstensor-case2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper is awarded with IEEE CASE 2020 Best Conference Paper Award","tags":["Spatiotemporal Analysis","Spatial Time Series","Tensor Decomposition","Tensor","Tensor Completion","Data Efficiency","Smart Mobility"],"title":"Long-Short Term Spatiotemporal Tensor Prediction for Passenger Flow Profile","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI","Nurettin Dorukhan Sergin","Hao Yan","Chen Zhang","Fugee Tsung"],"categories":["AAAI","Conference"],"content":" Award:\n This paper is awarded with Best Student Paper Finalist Award in INFORMS 2020 Quality, Statistics, and Reliability (QSR) Section.\n Challenge From our last paper, we found out low-rank tensor completion tends to ill-perform in heterogeneous stations. This is because LRTC assume a low rank structure in data, i.e. low-rank property implies that data in all stations are strongly and linearly dependent. However, two spatial correlations in station dimension are observed: only stations that are geographically close or functionally similar are more likely to have same passenger flow patterns. We offered a temporary solution by conducting LRTC within each station cluster to guarantee low-rank structure. But we would also like to look for a better solution, a low-rank tensor completion method that could directly handle the data with local spatial correlations.\nMethodology Therefore we proposed a tensor completion method for Weakly-dependent Data on Graph (WDG). We formulate the geographical correlation and functional similarity as two graphs, and introduce them as two Laplacian regularizations into LRTC, namely, into station-feature matrix $\\mathbf{U}^{station}$, such that if two stations are close on the two graphs, they have similar parameters on $\\mathbf{U}^{station}$. Besides, since there are those two graphs on station dimension, if any 2 stations are randomly picked, they’re less likely to be highly-dependent if they’re not connected in either of two graphs. We formulate this weak dependency as a sparse coding via $l_1$-norm, such that a station is represented with only a small amount of highly-related stations as “basis”.\nResults We are the first work to provide a Low Rank Tensor Completion solution to weakly-dependent pattern on graphs. And the completion result could achieve 40% higher accuracy.\n","date":1585902777,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585902777,"objectID":"301e0d56447b06e6b132164f145d35b7","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/wdgtc-aaai20/","publishdate":"2020-04-03T16:32:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wdgtc-aaai20/","section":"publication","summary":"Low-rank tensor decomposition and completion have attracted significant interest from academia given the ubiquity of tensor data. However, the low-rank structure is a global property, which will not be fulfilled when the data presents complex and weak dependencies given specific graph structures. One particular application that motivates this study is the spatiotemporal data analysis. As shown in the preliminary study, weakly dependencies can worsen the low-rank tensor completion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition and completion framework by introducing the L1-norm penalty and Graph Laplacian penalty to model the weakly dependency on graph. We further propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Block Coordinate Descent for efficient estimation. A case study based on the metro passenger flow data in Hong Kong is conducted to demonstrate improved performance over the regular tensor completion methods.","tags":["Tensor Decomposition","Tensor Completion","Graph","Prediction","Spatiotemporal Analysis","Tensor"],"title":"Tensor Completion for Weakly-dependent Data on Graph for Metro Passenger Flow Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI","Fugee Tsung"],"categories":["Journal"],"content":"","date":1585367562,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585367562,"objectID":"1e6337d99946abcfc5d22e08211dd5ea","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/discussion-paper/","publishdate":"2020-03-28T11:52:42+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/discussion-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The dependency structure of complex data is always a challenge in formulating and yielding accurate estimates. Dr Laura M. Sangalli’s paper offers a well-developed method to formulate the boundary spatial dependency by using the PDE regularization term, but other forms of spatial or spatiotemporal dependencies also need more efforts to solve. After a more accurate model and estimation, monitoring can be further conducted to contribute more practical value to the process control. The two most popular ways to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies can be summarized as follows: the first is to introduce regularization terms according to the auxiliary information; the second is to form data in tensor form, especially high-dimensional data, and then apply the corresponding tensor analysis method. Last but not least, after performing accurate estimation, a monitoring statistic can be constructed and the monitoring scheme applied to calculate the control limit and start the quality control process.","tags":["Profile Monitoring","Functional Data","Spatiotemporal Analysis"],"title":"Discussion of 'A novel approach to the analysis of spatial and functional data over complex domains' ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583312872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583312872,"objectID":"7f88c7c044ee3409b489001c58f5f7b9","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/my-dating-hack/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T17:07:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-dating-hack/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Prediction"],"title":"My Dating Hack","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ziyue LI"],"categories":["Competition"],"content":"","date":1583309763,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583309763,"objectID":"4ee35dcf32773d55424929f343ecd970","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/jd-prediction/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T16:16:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/jd-prediction/","section":"project","summary":"The Sale Prediction","tags":["JD.COM","Global Competition"],"title":"JD Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566459996,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566459996,"objectID":"bcba5edfc23818c9a75cdbda54edad38","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/post/my-arhikes/","publishdate":"2019-08-22T15:46:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/my-arhikes/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My Hikes","type":"post"}]

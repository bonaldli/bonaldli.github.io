However, the low-rank structure is a global property, which will not be fulfilled when the data presents complex and weak dependencies given specific graph structures. One particular application that motivates this study is the spatiotemporal data analysis. As shown in the preliminary study, weakly dependencies can worsen the low-rank tensor completion performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition and completion framework by introducing the L1-norm penalty and Graph Laplacian penalty to model the weakly dependency on graph. We further propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Block Coordinate Descent for efficient estimation. A case study based on the metro passenger flow data in Hong Kong is conducted to demonstrate improved performance over the regular tensor completion methods.","tags":["Tensor Decompositoin","Tensor Completion","Graph Structure","Prediction","Spatiotemporal Analysis"],"title":"Tensor Completion for Weakly-dependent Data on Graph for Metro Passenger Flow Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bonald Ziyue LI","Fugee Tsung"],"categories":["Journal"],"content":"","date":1585367562,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585367562,"objectID":"1e6337d99946abcfc5d22e08211dd5ea","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/publication/discussion-paper/","publishdate":"2020-03-28T11:52:42+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/discussion-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The dependency structure of complex data is always a challenge in formulating and yielding accurate estimates. Dr Laura M. Sangalliâ€™s paper offers a well-developed method to formulate the boundary spatial dependency by using the PDE regularization term, but other forms of spatial or spatiotemporal dependencies also need more efforts to solve. After a more accurate model and estimation, monitoring can be further conducted to contribute more practical value to the process control. The two most popular ways to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies can be summarized as follows: the first is to introduce regularization terms according to the auxiliary information; the second is to form data in tensor form, especially high-dimensional data, and then apply the corresponding tensor analysis method. Last but not least, after performing accurate estimation, a monitoring statistic can be constructed and the monitoring scheme applied to calculate the control limit and start the quality control process.","tags":["Profile Monitoring","Functional Data","Spatiotemporal Analysis"],"title":"Discussion of 'A novel approach to the analysis of spatial and functional data over complex domains' ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bonald Ziyue LI"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583312872,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583312872,"objectID":"7f88c7c044ee3409b489001c58f5f7b9","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/my-dating-hack/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T17:07:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-dating-hack/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Prediction"],"title":"My Dating Hack","type":"project"},{"authors":["Bonald Ziyue LI"],"categories":["Competition"],"content":"","date":1583309763,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583309763,"objectID":"4ee35dcf32773d55424929f343ecd970","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/project/jd-prediction/","publishdate":"2020-03-04T16:16:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/jd-prediction/","section":"project","summary":"The Sale Prediction","tags":["JD.COM","Global Competition"],"title":"JD Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1566459996,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566459996,"objectID":"bcba5edfc23818c9a75cdbda54edad38","permalink":"https://bonaldli.github.io/post/my-arhikes/","publishdate":"2019-08-22T15:46:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/my-arhikes/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"My Hikes","type":"post"}]
